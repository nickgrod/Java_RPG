Enemies is a (currently) text-based game in the making. So far the main pieces of logic are there for the big portions.
Battles will be between the enemy, the hero and the sidekick. The sidekick has the ability to steal powers
from defeated enemies, to be used later in the same. There is currently a very basic leveling system which will be
expanded upon.
